                    Born 1962, Syracuse, New York. One day he asked 
                    <a href="https://oblivion-film.fandom.com/wiki/Julia_Rusakova"target="_blank">Julia Rusakova</a> 
                    to meet him at the Empire State building. When she arrived they gazed at each other before going up to 
                    the roof where Jack told her to look through a telescope saying "Look through here and I will show you 
                    the future". As she did this he held up an engagement ring in front of the lens. Julia paused for a 
                    moment and they looked into each others eyes before Julia drew him into a loving embrace and accepted 
                    his proposal. During the mission the crew compartment known as the "Odyssey" was ejected. His wife, 
                    Julia Rusakova, was amongst the crew members saved - all in a state of delta sleep. Jack and co-pilot 
                    Victoria Olsen were captured by the Tet in order to use their genetic material for producing thousands 
                    of clones, among them Victoria 49, Jack 49, and Jack 52, who were later used on Earth. Their fates 
                    remain unknown.
